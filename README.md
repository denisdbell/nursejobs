# Nurse Jobs (http://138.68.173.197/)

Nurse Jobs is a web application which allows nurses to easily find their dream jobs.

## Architecture Overview

The application utilizes a mircoservcie architecture consisting of four(4) main components:

1. **Web Client** - This is an Angular2 web client which communicates with two restful endpoints; the Job API and the **search.gov API**.

2. **Job API** - This SpringBoot based Restful API application. It is utilized to faciliate the retrieval and saving of jobs  obtained from the **search.gov API**.

3. **My SQL Database** - The MySQL database is used to store user selected jobs. The **Job API** retrives and stores jobs in this database.

4. **Search.Gov API** - This API is used to retrieve nurse jobs currently being posted by the Federal, state, and local government agencies in the United States. 

The schematic diagram below shows the architecture of the system:

## Docker Compose

Docker is used for application deployment and configuration management. The Details of how the various components of the system communicate can be viewed from the **docker-compose.yml** file, see below:

```
